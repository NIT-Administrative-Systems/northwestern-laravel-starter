title: Database Snapshots
description: Using database snapshots to quickly restore state during development
---

Database snapshots allow you to save the current state of your database and quickly restore it later. This is invaluable during development when you need to:

- Test data modifications and quickly reset to a known state
- Quickly switch between different test scenarios
- Preserve data before making potentially destructive changes

:::note[Development Only]
Database snapshots are intended for development and testing environments only. For production backups, use proper database backup solutions.

## Creating Snapshots

### Basic Snapshot Creation

Create a snapshot with a descriptive name:

```bash
php artisan db:snapshot:create my-snapshot-name
```

The snapshot will be saved to the `database/snapshots/` directory.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Rebuild database with fresh data
php artisan db:rebuild

# Create some test data through the UI

# Save this state
php artisan db:snapshot:create clean-test-data

# Now you can make changes, and restore whenever needed
php artisan db:snapshot:restore clean-test-data
```

## Listing Snapshots

View all available snapshots:

```bash
php artisan db:snapshot:list
```

## Restoring Snapshots

Restore a snapshot by name:

```bash
php artisan db:snapshot:restore my-snapshot-name
```

:::caution[Destructive Operation]
Restoring a snapshot will **completely replace** your current database with the snapshot data. All current data will be lost.
