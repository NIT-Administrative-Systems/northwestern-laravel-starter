import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Initial Setup

### 1. Clone Project

If you're starting a new project using this starter:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NIT-Administrative-Systems/northwestern-laravel-starter.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name

# Initialize a fresh repository
git init -b develop # or `main` depending on your branching strategy
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit from Northwestern Laravel Starter"
```

### 2. Provision Required Services

The application expects specific services to exist before you can begin local development:

<Steps>
    1. **Create Databases**

        Create the two databases required by the application:

        ```text
        your_project_name_local   # Primary application database
        your_project_name_test    # PHPUnit test database
        ```

    2. **Create MinIO Bucket**

        Create a bucket for local object storage:

        ```text
        your-project-name
        ```

</Steps>

### 3. Update Configuration Files

<Steps>
    1. **`.env.example`**

        Update the file by referencing the services you created in the previous step and setting other project-specific defaults:

        ```bash
        APP_NAME="Your Project Name"
        APP_URL=https://your-project-name.test
        DB_DATABASE=your_project_name_local
        DB_PHPUNIT_DATABASE=your_project_name_test
        AWS_BUCKET=your-project-name
        AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-entra-id-client-id
        ```

        Ideally, these changes should be committed to your repository to serve as the base configuration for other developers.


    2. **`herd.yml`**

        If you're using [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com), update the `name` field to match your folder/repository name:

        ```diff
        - name: northwestern-laravel-starter
        + name: your-project-name
        ```
</Steps>

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
herd init    # If using Laravel Herd
herd secure  # If using Laravel Herd

composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

nvm install
nvm use v24
npm install -g pnpm@latest-10 # If pnpm is not already installed

pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 5. Environment Configuration

In your **LOCAL** `.env` file, the follow environment variables must be set:

```bash
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-value-here
DIRECTORY_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-value-here
EVENT_HUB_API_KEY=your-value-here # Only if the EventHub integration is needed
````

### 6. Validate Configuration

To ensure your environment is correctly configured, run:

```bash
php artisan config:validate
````

If any issues are detected, the command will output error messages to help you resolve them.

### 6. Database Scaffolding

```bash
php artisan db:rebuild
```

This will:

- Create all database tables
- Seed system permissions
- Seed default roles
- Seed role types
- Seed example users

:::caution
This command is only intended for local and testing environments. Use this as needed as the schema or seeders change during development.
:::

## Verification

### Test the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
# If using Laravel Herd, your site should already be available at:
http://your-project-name.test

# Otherwise, use the built-in PHP server:
php artisan serve
```

Visit the application in your browser. You should see the homepage.
