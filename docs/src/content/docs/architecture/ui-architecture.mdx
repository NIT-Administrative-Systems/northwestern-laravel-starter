The starter is architected with **two separate and distinct UI stacks**. This dual-stack approach is optimized to deliver the best experience for different audiences and use cases: a custom, branded stack for users, and a rapid administration panel for staff/developers.

## User Facing Interface - Northwestern Laravel UI

This stack is dedicated to creating a cohesive, branded experience for end-users and the public.

**Repository:** [Northwestern Laravel UI](https://github.com/NIT-Administrative-Systems/northwestern-laravel-ui)

### Stack Details

* **View Layer:** Blade Templates
* **Styling:** Customized Bootstrap 5
* **Icons:** Font Awesome

### Purpose & Use Cases

* **Public Facing Pages:** Landing pages, informational content.
* **Custom Experiences:** User dashboards, complex custom workflows.
* **Branding:** Achieving the official **Northwestern branded look and feel**.
* **Design Flexibility:** Provides full control over the design and frontend code.

> **Example:** The application's default home page (`/`) is built entirely with this stack.

## Administration Interface - Filament

This stack provides a rapid application development framework for internal staff, focused on data management and configuration.

**Framework:** [Filament](https://filamentphp.com)

### Stack Details

* **View Layer:** Filament
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Icons:** Heroicons

### Purpose & Use Cases

* **Staff/Developer Admin:** Internal tooling and system configuration.
* **Data Management:** Full **CRUD** operations and interactive tables.
- **Analytics:** Custom reporting dashboards and chart metrics.
* **Access:** Available at the `/administration` panel (requires authentication and specific permissions).

## Choosing the Right Stack

The choice between stacks depends entirely on the audience and the required level of customization.

    </Card>

    <Card title="Filament" icon="rocket">
        <Badge text="Best For" variant="success" />
        * **Staff Admin Panels**
        * Rapid CRUD Operations
        * User/System Configuration
        * Analytics Dashboards
        * Internal Staff Tooling

        * **Limited UI Customization**
        * Often not suitable for public users
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Filament Architecture

Filament's power lies in its structure based on **Panels** and **Resources**.

### Filament Panels

A **Panel** is a discrete, isolated area of the site with its own navigation, set of resources, and pages.

> **Example:** Everything under `/administration` is driven by the `AdministrationPanelProvider`.

#### Panel ID & Authorization

When adding a new Panel, the **ID** is critical for authorization:

```php {4, 10}
// app/Providers/Filament/AdministrationPanelProvider.php
class AdministrationPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public const string ID = 'administration';

    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->default()
            ->id(self::ID)
            // . . .
    }
}
```

The initial access check for the entire panel is determined by the `User::canAccessPanel()` method, which uses this ID constant to execute the appropriate permission check.

### Filament Resources

Filament adapts Eloquent Models to its system using *Resources*. This is where the configuration for the tables, filters, and CRUD screens resides.

<Aside title="Filament Resources vs. Eloquent Resources" type="caution">
    Filament Resources are a different concept from Laravel's built-in [Eloquent Resources](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent-resources). They are primarily for UI definition.
</Aside>

#### Generating Resources

To ensure correct mapping to the application's domain structure, you must specify the model namespace when generating a resource:
```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource User --generate --model-namespace=App\\Domains\\User\\Models
```
The `--generate` flag is highly recommended as it uses model introspection to create reasonable defaults for forms and columns.

#### Relation Managers

To facilitate relationships between resources (e.g., users belonging to a role), you use *Relation Managers*. You must specify the related model's full path:
```bash
# Example: Generating a manager for the Role::users() relationship
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager --related-model=App\\Domains\\User\\Models\\User --attach Role users username
```
